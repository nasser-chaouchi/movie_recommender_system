This project is an interactive movie recommendation system built with **Streamlit**, powered by **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid algorithms**. It leverages datasets of up to **32 million ratings** to provide tailored suggestions based on user preferences or selected movies.

---

## Features

- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering (genres, year)
- Hybrid approaches combining ratings and content
- Multiple recommendation modes:
  - By movie title
  - By user ID
  - Manual movie selection
  - Popular picks by genre, year, or globally
- Ready-to-use **Streamlit app**

---
